This project creates a simple voice-activated virtual assistant that listens for commands, plays music, tells the time, provides Wikipedia information, tells jokes, and responds to basic queries using speech recognition and text-to-speech synthesis. This project helps me learn about Python's capabilities for creating interactive applications.
